code_review_rules:
  code_length_and_reusability:
    - "Code should not be too long, making it difficult to read and understand."
    - "Repeated code should be refactored into methods to improve reusability."
    - "If too many columns are used in grouping and filtering, and they are used in multiple places, they should be stored in a configuration file."
    - "Line length should follow PEP8 guidelines."

  configuration_usage:
    - "Raw data paths, KPI names, email lists, and credential information used in scenarios should be stored in a configuration file."

  runtime_information:
    - "Provide information about the current stage of execution within the scenario using a logging library."

  execution_time_control:
    - "Runner-trainer job durations in Airflow should be monitored."
    - "Long-running Spark and Pandas code should be reviewed and optimized."
    - "Use the time function to log execution durations of code segments."

  exception_handling:
    - "Use Try-Catch structures in data retrieval, data writing, and key computation areas to catch errors."

  error_reporting:
    - "After using a Try-Catch block, execution can continue if errors are non-critical, but since Airflow jobs wonâ€™t fail, an email should be sent to the developer or team."

  detailed_data_logging:
    - "Even if not affecting code quality, values not sent to the customer but contributing to anomalies (e.g., std, mean, anomaly score) should be logged."

  code_readability:
    - "Add comments only where necessary to improve readability."
    - "Write docstrings explaining the purpose of methods, parameters (with types), and return values (with types)."

  readme_file:
    - "After completing the scenario and preparing the Armada documentation, add the Armada link, record name, or ID to the Readme.md file in the repository."
    - "The Readme.md file should include information such as how to run the code and crontab schedules."

  mail_logger_check:
    - "Ensure mail logger functionality is verified."

  armada_documentation:
    - "Ensure the Armada documentation is correctly maintained."

  output_tracking:
    - "Monitor the average execution time of Airflow jobs."
    - "Monitor the average resource usage of Airflow jobs."
